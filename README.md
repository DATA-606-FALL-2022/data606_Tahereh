## Code
The comlete ccode implementing the project including data generation, trainig, test, and analysis of the result be found [here](https://github.com/DATA-606-FALL-2022/data606_Tahereh/blob/main/02_train_and_test_DenseNet.ipynb).

## Data
The data for the project is a synthetic dataset which is obtained by running [this notebook](https://github.com/DATA-606-FALL-2022/data606_Tahereh/blob/main/01_data_Generator.ipynb).
